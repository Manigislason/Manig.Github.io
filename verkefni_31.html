        <h3>Litafræði</h3>
        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the 
        readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using 
        Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters,
        as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable
        English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem
         Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover 
        many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years,
         sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

        <h3>Leturfræði</h3>
        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
        when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a 
        type specimen book. <blockquote>Has survived not only five centuries, but also the 
        leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. </blockquote>
        It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing 
        Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software 
        like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
        Why do we use it?
